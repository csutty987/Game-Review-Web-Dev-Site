		What is becoming more and more rare in today's games market, is a brand new IP that stands on it's
		own two feet. Horizon Zero Dawn does that and more, being one of the first big reason's to even own
		a PlayStation 4. Bringing next-generation graphics with their new Decima engine, in conjunction with
		innovative Bow & Arrow-oriented gameplay and a thrilling mysterious sci-fi story, Guerrilla Games
		truly deliver an awe-some experience for the new generation of consoles.

		Ayloy - the main character of Horizon Zero Dawn provides a great anchor for the player's experience
		within the game world. You come to truly care for Ayloy after you play as her when she was just a 
		child. This makes you care much more about the character before you even reach 1 hour into the game, 
		as you experience her inexcusable shunning and banishment from her tribe for a mystery that you slowly
		uncover throughout the game. Other characters such as her father-figure Rost provide great emotional
		reactions as the story plays out.

		When you think of Bow & Arrow gameplay, you may think of traditional medieval games or fantasy RPG's
		such as Skyrim, where the bow was a relatively slow paced gameplay feature only really usable at long range.
		Horizon Zero Dawn does a brilliant job at reinventing this kind of gameplay, allowing it to be much more 
		fast-paced, agile and strategic. Do you take more time aiming for the head of an enemy, risking your own 
		health, or do you just go for a quicker shot to the body? On top of this, abilities such as slowing down
		time, giving you a better shot are an added strategic option in the combat. You would think that just using a
		 bow & arrow and nothing else in an entire game may get old, which is why Guerrilla were able to come with 
		a number of other brilliant weapons such as the tripcaster, the sling and the ropecaster, each with it's own
		ideal gameplay mechanics. On top of that, you are always welcome to melee enemies with Aloy's spear.

		At a time where most game developers were looking to reinvent past successes for the new generation of
		consoles, Guerrilla Games were able to provide players with a completely fresh experience, utilizing 
		new technology to their benefit while crafting a brilliant mysterious sci-fi story to give you at least
		one fantastic reason to own a PlayStation 4.
