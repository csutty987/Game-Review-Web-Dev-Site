	<h4>Despite DICE's best intentions, Battlefront 2 remains a shallow, disappointing experience.</h4>

		The now-famed interaction between <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?st=JH2MUORV&sh=5997c5a5">the EA Community Team and a fan on reddit</a> spelled doom
		<em>very</em> early on in the lifespan of Battlefront 2. Content, both cosmetic and gameplay
		-changing were initially locked behind a pay-wall or an EXTREME length of time played in the game,
		resulting in many fans to ignore the game completely, boycotting EA and their well-documented aggressive
		microtransactions.

		Since then, the game has been updated extensively with new maps and new characters, as well as a
		complete overhaul of the gameplay at one point. Giving the name "Battlefront 2" to a game today
		means drawing comparisons with the classic Battlefront II of 2005. DICE's Battlefront 2 falls short
		in just about every area. The gameplay is more shallow, favouring (very impressive) graphics and sound
		design over depth of gameplay. Vehicle combat is flatout not enjoyable, whereas the classic gave much more
		access to a better designed vehicle combat system. Heroes gameplay is simply terrible, resulting in a 
		spam attack with the occasional use of a force ability. Essentially, DICE took their hit franchise Battlefield,
		and Star Wars-ed it, resulting in a lack of content and uniqueness.

		After backlash for not having any singleplayer mode in the 2015 Battlefront, DICE attempted a singleplayer story
		in this sequel, however they completely missed the mark. Once again, comparing to the 2005 iteration, where you play
		as the 501st Clone Army and experience their journey from the Clone Wars all the way to the Empire, it was truly a unique
		and epic story. DICE chose a much more personal story of one Iden Versio, an elite stormtrooper who struggles with what to do
		after the death of the Emperor. The scale of the story is much smaller, and while it does provide the odd grand moment with 
		character such as General Leia, the campaign simply does not have the scale of it's 2005 predecessor.

	<p>
		As many players got tired of the same few maps and lack of iconic Star Wars characters, EA announced this month that the game
		will no longer be supported, in other words, any future planned updates have been cancelled.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the disastrous launch of Battlefront 2, DICE fought hard to get the game in a playable state, removing pay-to-win features,
		altering the gameplay and adding a <strong>lot</strong> more content to provide their playerbase with a better game. Ultimately however,
		it was <strong>too little, too late.</strong>
