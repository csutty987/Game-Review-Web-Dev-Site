	<h4>As 2K get caught up in bans and backlash around the globe for gambling features, NBA 2K20 continues to reach huge levels of cultural success</h4>
</div>
<div class="art-content">
	<p>
		Before the game was even released, 2K received backlash for their heavily stylised trailer around slot machines
		and other gambling staples in their "MyTeam" game mode. Seemingly owning the fact that many games
		these days have become gambling pits with microtransactions, they seemed to hold no shame in providing a 
		game that is aged 3 with heavy gambling themes.
	</p>
	<p>
		In recent years, the 2K franchise has been mocked and hated by it's fanbase who still put up with it,
		while NBA players in real life are brought more and more into the game to provide the cultural incentive
		for young fans to play it, because "their favourite player likes the game". 
	</p>
	<p>
		The level of aggression in NBA 2k20's microtransactions is unparallelled. While in FIFA, you can easily avoid 
		microtransactions if you don't much play Ultimate Team, in NBA 2k20, the game is SURROUNDED by them. The main 
		attraction of NBA 2k20 is it's career mode, in which you start your character at the bottom of the food chain, 
		a lowly level 60 incapable of really enjoying the game, as your character slowly jogs up and down the court with  
		a low speed stat, missing every shot with low shooting ratings and turning the ball over as your character simply is 
		incapable of dribbling the ball due to their stats. The rate at which you earn "Virtual Currency" or "VC" to upgrade 
		your player is simply unacceptable. It takes MONTHS of playing the game for several hours a day to even get close to 
		a competent character that can make shots. Or, you can pay for microtransactions and get that level 90 character on 
		the very first day of release. If you thought "It doesn't matter, it won't affect me I just won't buy VC", think again, 
		as you play multiplayer against people on day 1 of release who have just spent north of Â£100 on their character, so they 
		can mercilessly beat you down into wanting to quit the game due to the misery of missing every shot as your level 60 character 
		struggles to keep up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Take away the VC from the game, and what are you left with? A good game? Strong gameplay mechanics? Nope. NBA 2k20 uses animations
		to drive ALL of the game. There aren't even any ball physics in a sports game. It borders on laughable as you struggle for control
		over your own player as he gets locked into timed animations again and again in which you completely lose control of your player
		as he drives the ball out of bounds to the left while you are frantically pushing the analog stick for him to go right. 
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the only redeeming features of NBA 2k is the endorsements and detailed interactions within career mode that pop up every once in a while. 
		Even then however, a lot of the content is either rehashed from previous releases or simply left outdated or removed from the game. One such case
		is the All Star game, which is supposed to be a grand experience within the NBA season, but is reduced to a strange, outdated one-off game mode
		that is a complete mess with no context whatsoever.

		<h5>NBA 2K20 truly is one of the most miserable experiences in gaming you could spend money for.</h5>
