	<h4>MARVEL's Spiderman capitalizes on the great superhero character and all it's classic villains.
	With a promise to take you back to the time of the old PS2 classic, this reiteration delivers
	all promises with flying colours. A wonderful, joyous experience that knows what the focus ought 
	to be on: a personal story for Peter Parker and a fun, engaging combat system for Spiderman.</h4>

		The combat system borrows <em>heavily</em> from the highly regarded Batman Arkham games, 
		but copying never has nor ever will be something to be ashamed of if you can make it your 
		own, and Spiderman does just that. The fast-paced combo-oriented combat provides exactly 
		what superheroes need in game-format - quick, relatively easy combat.

		Insomniac knew that what was potentially the single most important aspect of the game would 
		be the swinging mechanics. In the past, this has been an area of debate for fans of previous 
		games. Most agree that the unrealistic approach of allowing you to swing anywhere (not requiring 
		an anchor for your webs) is not ideal. When the games for the PS2 were being released alongside 
		Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, people praised the games for their fluid movement and perfect 
		web-swinging mechanics. For near a decade, the Spiderman games released (in relation to Andrew 
		Garfield's movies) lost sense of the importance of these mechanics. I am happy to report, that 
		Insomniac have absolutely <strong>nailed</strong> these mechanics. Just 10 minutes into the game and 
		they give you a perfect intro to the game, the world and it's mechanics by literally throwing 
		you out of the bedroom window of Peter Parker and into the swinging mechanics right away.

		Combat alone is often not enough to make a great game. The story is, especially for me, 
		a huge part of the experience. So how does the web-slingers journey stand up to other, 
		more established stories within the games industry? Insomniac Games' most valuable aspect 
		of creating this game is that they understood the character of Spiderman. While other superheroes 
		(Batman) focus more on the gritty, dark tones of the world, Spiderman is all about the bright,
		light-hearted and joyous interactions within the world. This results in both small and large 
		details that reflect the personality of Peter Parker. Being able to walk up to any citizen of New 
		York and high-five them, or reply to their request for a selfie with Spidey gives just as much 	
		satisfaction as when you are fighting one of the many bosses in the game, be it Wilson Fisk, Shocker 
		or any of the other Sinister Six and Spiderman just cannot stop himself from making smart comments, 
		quirks and jokes.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my favourite aspects of the game was the open world, carefully crafted around the real city 
		of New York, complete with easter eggs and locations from the Marvel Cinematic Universe - such as 
		the Avengers Tower or Dr Strange's sanctum on Bleaker Street - makes exploration and side missions
		much more enjoyable as you swing around town at your own pace.
	</p>
	<p>
		The acting in Spiderman is key to making you feel connected the character's and their story, as not 
		only do you play as Peter Parker, but also take over segments of Mary Jane's story, as well as Miles 
		Morales. The actors play their parts perfectly, Insomniac even had the eye for detail to alter the voice 
		lines of dialogue. If you find yourself swinging around New York as Parker takes a phone call, the dialogue 
		plays as though Parker is out of breath, and excercising as he is swinging around. However, if you take the 
		same phone call while standing around on a rooftop, or on the ground, Parker is more normal, and his 
		dialogue does not sounds as though he is struggling for breath. This is a small detail, but a great 
		example of the attention to detail Insomniac games have payed for this game.
