	<h4>Yet another rehash of the previous FIFA release, this time with even LESS features?</h4>

		With sports games, it is <strong>extremely</strong> common that you do not get what you pay for.
		Most developers treat sports games as annual cash cows that are all essentially the same exact game,
		just slightly updated with new teams and players released annually for the same Â£49.99 price tag.
	</p>
	<p>
		The biggest change this year is actually a missing game mode. "The Journey" - the singleplayer
		storymode of FIFA seems to have come to an end, resulting in the primary single player experience
		returning once more to career mode - a game mode that literally hasn't changed for a good 5 years
		or so. The same character creator, even the same basic template faces that I remember using years
		ago when I was more into FIFA. Even the UI for how to request loans or transfers remains the same. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Gameplay in FIFA has always been fluid. When you compare the fluidity of movement in FIFA with the movement 
		in the NBA 2k franchise, there is a clear advantage to FIFA. The ball physics and player collision physics 
		in particular have seen a marked improvement over the years, mostly thanks to DICE's Frostbite Engine, which was 
		new to FIFA for the 2018 iteration.
	</p>
	<p>
		FIFA's leading game mode makes a return - Ultimate Team - to try to ease money out of everyone and their parent's 
		bank accounts. Microtransactions remain a staple in not just FIFA's profits, but also EA's. One thing that EA do understand, 
		is that they do not <em>need</em> to change a single detail about FIFA in order to continue to make an outrageous amount of 
		money from the franchise. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Another popular game mode - Pro Clubs makes a return with little to no new features, merely providing a slightly updated
		game engine with 2020's football players in exchange for 50 credits of the imperial realm.
