	<h4>A masterclass in how to produce a racing simulation with the perfect balance of realism and fun.</h4>

		The F1 franchise has been, for a couple of years now, one of the best racing sims available on the market. 
		As with all racing sims, it is best experienced with an expensive steering wheel and setup, however one of 
		the greatest traits of this franchise is that it is almost <em>just</em> as enjoyable with nothing more than 
		a controller. The driving mechanics, how the car steers, goes around corners and interact with curbs and wet 
		surfaces is simply perfect. Add to that a brilliant voice control system with your very own mechanics giving 
		you information as you race - named Jeff - gives you a full immersive experience of what it may be like to be 
		an F1 driver. New features this year include the F2 introduction to the career mode, with made-up characters that
		follow you to F1.

		The career mode in the F1 franchise has been the highlight of the experience for all. It provides a fully customizable
		experience in which you can choose what your character looks like, what team you race for, and how you race. This 
		includes the ability to speak with your manager and negotiate contract with teams, being able to interact with media after
		races and practice or qualifying sessions about how you almost crashed the car several times, and even how the team's car 
		is developed and improved upon over the season, from durability, to aerodynamics, chassis or engine upgrades, each giving
		the car an improvement in a specific area of performance. One brilliant little detail is the ability to give voice commands
		to your race engineer, from which he responds with information. You can say "Last Lap Time", and he will tell you your lap time
		from the last lap, you can ask for "Pit Stop Information" and he will tell you what tyres you will be changing onto at the next 
		pit stop, what lap the pit stop will be on and how your current tyres are looking at the moment. This pit stop strategy and 
		managing your tyres and fuel is an extra incredible aspect to the game to give it a more complete strategic side to the pure 
		racing gameplay. The voice commands even allow you to tell Jeff "Shut up Jeff" and he will stop giving automatic updates on the race
		 - which is just as useful as it is hilarious!

		The simulation of how the car reacts when the tyres are nearly dead or the rain is pounding down gives you a true sense of dread 
		as you battle with the car to keep grip on the track. Just like in real life, if you stray too far from the racing line when it is 
		raining, you will likely spin out due to puddles and standing water not found on the racing line. This is where yet another brilliant
		feature comes in - the safety car. Just when you think the race is going to be a straight forward and predictable race, one of the AI 
		crashes, and out comes the safety car. This allows players and AI alike to fight back and get lucky to pit under the safety car and gain 
		a couple of spots in the race.

		The realism of the tracks and the AI are what makes this racing sim one of the best on the market. Too often in racing games it is very
		difficult to find the balance between AI being too easy or too difficult. In F1 2019 you can alter the difficulty of the AI to the decimal!
		You can set the difficulty anywhere between 0 and 130, and it increments by 1, making it truly the most customizable difficulty in any game I 
		have ever seen.
	</p>
	<p>
		One final feature that needs mentioning in career mode is the rival system. Depending on how you drive and where your AI peers finish around you, 
		you can choose your rival and battle them in both qualifying and races for respect from drivers and teams around the paddock. Your first rival is 
		always your teammate, as you drive the same car, but after a few races you can choose your own rival and compete directly against them for every 
		millisecond in qualifying, or try to play dirty and get them to crash during the race by pushing them too far off track!
	</p>
	<p>
		The multiplayer of F1 games have recently been plagued by connectivity issues and many players who ruin the experience by not driving properly 
		and often crashing into other players. This year, Codemasters have made strides to counter that by introducing a 'Weekly Safety Rating' that rewards
		players for driving safely in multiplayer games. While the connectivity issues are still very much a problem, this year also allows players to fully
		customize their cars and their drivers.
