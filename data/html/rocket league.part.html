		An absolute thrill of fun, Rocket League gives something for everyone. If you want to play a 
		competitive multiplayer game and climb the ranked leaderboard, Rocket League has a great ranked 
		system and eSports scene. If you want to relax and just have fun with a group of friends, you can
		do just that too, even with it's own Mario-Kart style game mode that provides power-ups within the core
		football-style game.

		If Rocket League was just football with cars, it would be a very short-lived 2 dimensional arcade game. 
		The fact that you can use rockets to essentially fly up into the air to hit the ball gives the game a crucial
		third dimension of movement that increases the skill cap of the game and truly provides a challenge for 
		players to master.

	<p>
		Providing absolutely brilliant customization options for players to completely change the look of their cars,
		and a non-invasive microtransaction system that only caters to cosmetics gives the game an extended lifespan 
		for players who want to check out each new update and gain more cosmetic features for their cars.

		Rocket League quickly became a classic multiplayer game that stands up to other multiplayer classics such as
		Counter-Strike or League of Legends. Psyonix should also be applauded for their efforts in pioneering cross-
		platform play, allowing players on PS4 and other consoles, as well as PC to be able to play with and against each
		other with ease.
