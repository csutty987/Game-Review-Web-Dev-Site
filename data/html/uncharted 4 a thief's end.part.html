		Naughty Dog have become known for their story-based games that give us the chance to experience emotions 
		we never even knew existed. Uncharted 4 takes the beloved character of Nathan Drake, and gives a further 
		layer of complexity with a newly-invented long-lost brother, played outstandingly by Troy Baker.
	</p>
	<p>
		The gameplay of uncharted is further expanded and lends itself the the new generation of consoles' technology 
		brilliantly, with the use of a simple grapple rope that gives an extra dynamic in the exploration of the game world.
		The graphics are simply eye-candy, showcasing what the PS4 can do with a lot of foliage, and a lot of dirt. The
		Madagascar section of the game in particular truly makes your jaw drop.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course the puzzles of Uncharted are a staple, and Uncharted 4 is no different. As you are set on a wild goose chase
		for hidden pirate treasure you travel around the world from Scotland the Italy to Madagascar in search of clues.
		These slower, moments to give you a breather are riddled with gunplay in between as enemies try and stop you every step
		of the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout the game, you are given flashbacks to when Nathan Drake was younger, as he was being taken care of by his 
		older brother. These parts of the game give great context to the game and allow you to bond with the character's at 
		an even deeper level.
	</p>
	<p>
		Naughty Dog continue their tradition of emotional journeys with storytelling that can stand up to any movie or TV Show
		around, being propelled forward with the ever-improving motion capture technology allowing actors to convey even greater 
		performances, as Troy Baker and Nolan North prove why they are two of the most sought-after voice actors in the videogames 
		industry.
