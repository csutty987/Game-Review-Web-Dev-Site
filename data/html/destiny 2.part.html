	<h4>Bungie's second attempt at a renewed, Massively-Multiplayer First Person Shooter falls short yet again.</h4>
</div>
<div class="art-content">
	<p>
		Bungie have a strong basis for Destiny - an interesting backstory, diverse world full of potential, 
		and first person shooter combat that stems from Halo - one of the most popular franchises of all time.
		Yet a lack of clear focus and the intent to lock content behind DLC paywall's hinders Destiny from truly
		taking off at the level that Halo did.
	</p>
	<p>
		The singleplayer story of Destiny 2 is not even worth it. For some reason, Bungie insist on holding 
		the singleplayer experience to nothing more than a means to and end. It's sole purpose is to get you to max
		level (level 20) so that you can do more matchmaking and PvE group content (such as classic MMO-style raids 
		and dungeons), as well as collect better gear.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the PvP matchmaking in Destiny is reminiscent of classic Halo gameplay, ultimately it follows the 
		not-so-popular scheme of the more you play the game, the more of an advantage you have against other players.
		Classic FPS games allowed players of all experience to use the same equipment at the same time. Destiny 2 
		however follows the more recent play-to-win format that gives longtime-players an advantage over 
		newer players. And while some may see this as only fair, it makes anyone who tries to get into the game
		long after it's release in for one hell of a furious time. This results in only core fans of Destiny being able 
		to truly excel in the matchmaking, as you use your own weapons and gear that you collect through playing the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as positives for Destiny 2, the UI is extremely clean, and the interaction and customization between your 
		character and their ship, among other customizable things is enjoyable. I think the one thing holding Destiny back from
		reaching the usual success levels Bungie are used to is the decision to make this franchise an MMO. They offer a hybrid 
		between an FPS and an MMO, but it results in an average FPS, with average MMO features. For example, other MMO's, like 
		World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic have near a dozen different classes all with dozen's of unique abilities
		and playstyles. Destiny 2 however, has a mere 3 classes, that all play rather similarly. Each class has a jump ability, a 
		grenade ability, a melee ability and an ultimate ability. This means that the only truly unique part of each class is their
		ultimate, which provides little to no replayability, and a lack of strategy within the group make-up when looking to play
		the PvE content with friends.
