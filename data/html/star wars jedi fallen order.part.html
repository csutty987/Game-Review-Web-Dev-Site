	<h4>A unique take on Star Wars videogames, Respawn Entertainment give you a Star Wars Dark Souls game.</h4>

	<p>
		This is very much Dark Souls in the world of Star Wars. Respawn make that much very clear. The combat
		is based off Dark Souls, with an emphasis on blocking and dodging, while you use "meditation spots"
		which are essentially the Star Wars equivalent of bonfires in Dark Souls. They save your progress, 
		refill your health and force, and also respawn all enemies that you may have defeated, save for a few
		unique bosses.

		Cal Cestis, the protagonist of Jedi: Fallen Order is a young Jedi who survived Order 66 and went into hiding.
		Having never completed his Jedi training, he provides the player with a mouldable Jedi who progresses and 
		learns along with the player perfectly. Cal is accompanied by a crew of the Mantis, including Greez, a 
		charismatic pilot with 4 arms that reminds me very much of Han Solo - a man who really does have a good heart,
		 but tries to hide it with comments about how he really would rather just be making money at the moment. Then, 
		there is Cal's mentor - Cere Junda. A former Jedi with a mysterious past that lead her to cutting herself off 
		from the force.

		While there are weak points here and there in the story, it holds up as a very compelling journey through 
		post-Republic time where the rebellion is yet to be formed, and the only semblance of rebellion you meet in 
		this story is Clone Wars and Rogue One character Saw Guerrera. The locations that you journey through in Fallen Order
		include Kashhyyk - the Wookie homeworld, Dathomir - the dark-side-shrouded Darth Maul planet, Zeffo - home to an
		ancient race of Force users, and Bogano, a secret Jedi hideout. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Respawn entertainment knew that at the core of the game would be the lightsaber combat. They wanted you to feel
		like a Jedi as you play the game, and they managed to deliver on that goal as lightsaber combat lends itself 
		brilliantly to the Dark Souls-style combat.
